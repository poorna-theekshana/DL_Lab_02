1. What happens when the number of hidden nodes increases?
- Increasing the number of hidden nodes generally improves the model's ability to learn and represent complex patterns, leading to higher accuracy initially.

2. Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?
- Accuracy improves significantly up to 3 hidden nodes.
- It continues to improve slightly until 5 hidden nodes.
- Beyond 5 hidden nodes, accuracy plateaus or slightly decreases, likely due to overfitting and diminishing returns on additional complexity.
